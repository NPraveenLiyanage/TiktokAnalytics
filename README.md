# TikTok Analytics Dashboard

This project provides a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard for analyzing TikTok video data. It allows users to gain insights into video performance, engagement metrics, and hashtag trends.

## Features

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Displays total videos, average views, average engagement rate, and total likes.
- **Performance Overview:** Visualizes content performance distribution (High, Medium, Low) and the relationship between engagement rate and views using scatter plots.
- **Engagement Analysis:** Provides insights into average likes, comments, and shares.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles `createTime` conversion, extracts hashtags from descriptions, and calculates engagement rates.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file that runs the dashboard.
- `tiktokdata.csv`: (Expected) The dataset containing TikTok video information.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the application.
- `tiktokanalytics/`: A directory that appears to contain virtual environment files and potentially other project-related scripts.
